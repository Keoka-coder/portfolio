Portfolio assignment — commit-by-section plan

This repository will be built with only HTML and CSS and staged with multiple commits.

Planned commit sequence:

1. "Add header and base layout" — header, navigation, base home section, link to normalize.css and stylesheet.
2. "Add sidebar and responsive layout" — introduce a left sidebar with quick links, social icons.
3. "Add About section" — detailed about content and skills list.
4. "Add Projects section" — at least three projects with descriptions, tech list, and links.
5. "Add Contact section and footer details" — contact links and accessible form-like links.
6. "Polish styles and responsiveness" — final CSS tweaks and minor accessibility improvements.

How to preview locally:

Notes:
- normalize.css is included via CDN in `index.html`.
- Custom styles are in `styles/style.css`.

Status: initial header and base layout added.
